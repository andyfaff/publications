	Australia. Platypus is a multipurpose spectrometer for the characterisation
	of solid thin films, materials adsorbed at the solid–liquid interface
	and free-liquid surfaces. It also has the capacity to study magnetic
	thin films using spin-polarised neutrons. Platypus utilises a white
	neutron beam (lambda 2–20A) that is pulsed using boron-coated disc
	chopper pairs; thus providing the capacity to tailor the wavelength
	resolution of the pulses to suit the system under investigation.
	Supermirror optical components are used to focus, deﬂect or spin-polarise
	the broad bandwidth neutron beams, and typical incident spectra are
	presented for each conﬁguration. A series of neutron reflectivity
	datasets are presented, indicating the quality and flexibility of
	this spectrometer. Minimum reflectivity values of <10^-7 are observed;
	while maximum thickness values of 325 nm have been measured for single-component
	films and 483 nm for a multilayer system. Off-specular measurements
	have also been made to investigate in-plane features as opposed to
	those normal to the sample surface. Finally, the first published studies
	conducted using the Platypus time-of-flight neutron reflectometer are
	presented.},

	prop- erties of such a mixed system. Simplicity was achieved using
	designed sequences in which chemical differences had been eliminated
	to isolate the effect of molecular size and structure, namely a short
	unstructured peptide (DAMP1) and its longer structured protein concatamer
	(DAMP4). Interfacial tension measurements suggested that the size

	kinetics. Neutron reflectometry at equilibrium revealed that both
	molecules adsorbed as a monolayer to the air–water interface (indicating
	unfolding of DAMP4 to give a chain of four connected DAMP1 molecules),
	with a concentration ratio equal to that in the bulk. This suggests
	the overall free energy of adsorption is equal despite differences
	in size and bulk structure. At small interfacial extensional strains,
	only molecule packing influenced the stress response. At larger strains,
	the effect of size became apparent, with DAMP4 registering a higher
	stress response and interfacial elasticity. When both components
	were present at the interface, most stress-dissipating movement was
	achieved by DAMP1. This work thus provides insights into the role

  pages = {5131-5139},
  abstract = {The success of hydrolysis in improving the functional foaming properties
	of surface-active proteins is usually attributed to three factors:
	decreased molecular size; increased hydrophobicity; and microchemical
	changes, specifically deamidation of glutamine and asparagine. Studying
	these individual factors is difficult using naturally-occurring proteins,
	as hydrolysate products are complex mixed systems, and the mechanisms
	of foam stabilization are likewise complex. To address this complexity
	we report studies of a recombinant protein (DAMP4) which comprises
	four peptide surfactant (DAMP1) molecules connected by acid-labile
	amino acid (Asp-Pro) linkers. Hydrolysis of DAMP4 under conditions
	of low pH and high temperature produced h-DAMP1, a mixture of deamidated
	variants of the chemically-synthesized DAMP1 peptide surfactant.
	By examining foaming performance of these molecules, we are able
	to isolate the effects of molecule size (DAMP1 vs DAMP4) and deamidation
	(h-DAMP1 vs DAMP1). Molecule size had little effect on foaming for
	the conditions studied. However, deamidation completely changed foaming
	behaviour, most likely due to alteration of interfacial charge structure
	(through deamidation of glutamine to glutamic acid) and consequent

	triﬂuoromethylsulfonylimide [C4mpyr][NTf2] ionic liquid was investigated
	using X-ray reflectometry. The measured reflectivity data suggests
	a signiﬁcant amount of water is adsorbed at the surface, with the
	ﬁrst layer from the gas (nitrogen)–liquid phase boundary mainly occupied
	by a mixture of cations and water. Beyond the cation + water layer,
	the scattering length density increases towards the bulk value, indicating
	a decreasing amount of water and cations, and/or an increasing amount
	of anions. The orientation of the butyl chain of cation at the phase
	boundary and the population of water at the surface were described
	based on results from an independent molecular dynamics (MD) simulation.
	We show that the presence of water in the ionic liquid has a non-monotonic
	eﬀect on the overall thickness of the surface. At low water content,
	the addition of water does not change the surface thickness since
	water is mainly present in the bulk. As the water content increases,
	the surface swells before eventually shrinking down close to the
	solubility limit of water. The non-monotonic surface thickness is
	used to explain the anomalous trend of surface tension in ionic liquid–water
	mixtures reported in the literature.},

	The solubility of the polymer can be controlled and varies from poor
	to good by the addition of sodium chloride salt. Ellipsometry was
	used to demonstrate that polySBMA adsorbs to silica and exhibits
	an increase in surface excess at lower salt concentration, which
	is consistent with a smaller area
	
	per molecule at low salt concentration. Neutron reflectivity measurements
	show that the adsorbed polymer has a thickness of about 3.7 nm and
	is highly hydrated. The polymer can be used to exercise considerable
	control over suspension rheology. When silica particles are not completely
	covered in polymer, the suspension produces a highly viscous gel.
	Atomic force microscopy was used to show this is caused by bridging
	of polymer between the particles. At higher surface coverage, the
	polymer can produce either a high or very lo viscosity slurry depending
	on the sodium
	
	chloride concentration. At high salt concentration, the suspension
	is stable, and the viscosity is lower. This is probably because the
	entrainment of many small ions renders the polymer film highly hydrophilic,
	producing repulsive surface forces and lubricating the flow of particles.
	At low salt concentrations, the polymer is barely soluble and more
	densely adsorbed. This produces less stable and more viscous solutions,

Joule heating and the external environment. In this work, neutron reflectometry (NR) was
used to probe the effect of heat on the morphology of thin three-layer organic films
comprising materials typically found in OLEDs. It was found that layers within the films
began to mix when heated to approximately 20 °C above the glass-transition temperature
(Tg) of the material with the lowest Tg. Diffusion occurred when the material with the lowest
Tg formed a supercooled liquid, with the rates of interdiffusion of the materials depending on
the relative Tg’s. If the supercooled liquid formed at a temperature significantly lower than
the Tg of the higher-Tg material in the adjacent layer, then pseudo-Fickian diffusion occurred.
If the two Tg’s are similar, then the two materials can interdiffuse at similar rates. The type
and extent of diffusion observed can provide insight into and a partial explanation for the
“burn in” often observed for OLEDs. Photoluminescence measurements performed
simultaneously with NR measurements showed that interdiffusion of the materials from
the different layers had a strong effect on the emission of the film, with quenching generally
observed. These results emphasize the importance of using thermally stable materials in OLED devices to avoid film morphology changes.},

Herein we use neutron reflectometry to study changes in the structure of synthetic melanin thin films as a function of H2O and D2O vapour pressure. Water is found to be taken up evenly throughout the films, and by employing the contrast effect, the existence of labile protons through reversible deuterium exchange is demonstrated.

  abstract = {Electroactive graft copolymers with self-healing properties and stretchability were prepared using a conducting polythiophene phenylene backbone and self-healing poly(acetamidoalkyl acrylate) side chains. Two different acetamidoalkyl acrylate monomers were used for the grafted side chains, which were added via controlled radical polymerization: 3-acetamidopropyl acrylate and 6-acetamidohexyl acrylate. The graft copolymers were studied as thin films and in bulk form to determine the structure, electrochemical and mechanical properties of the materials. The difference in chemical nature of the two grafted side chains gives rise to materials with different glass transition temperatures, Young’s moduli and self-healing ability. We compare these two types of materials to understand the effect of the side chains on the self-healing properties of the materials. The grafted polythiophene phenylenes were observed to self-heal, at room temperature, within one minute of being cut. The copolymers had good electroactivity and conductivity when doped; however the doped material had reduced elasticity.},

Detection of the reflected neutron beam is via a 10-atmosphere, helium-3, linear position sensitive detector.

We report the effects of oxidative damage on the structure and properties of biomimetic phospholipid membrane systems. Two oxidation methods were used, in situ oxidation initiated using Fe(II) and ascorbate, and the incorporation of a synthetic “oxidized” phospholipid, PoxnoPC, into biomimetic membranes. The biomimetic systems employed included multibilayer stacks, tethered bilayers, and phospholipid monolayers studied using a combination of reflectometry, attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and neutron diffraction. We show that oxidation with Fe(II) and ascorbate caused an increase in the order of the membrane, attributed to cross-linking of the phospholipids, and a change in the electrical permeability of the membrane, but no significant impact on the thickness or completeness of the membrane. Incorporation of PoxnoPC, on the other hand, had a larger impact on the structure of the membrane. Inversion of the aldehyde-terminated truncated sn-2 chain of PoxnoPC into the head group region was observed, along with a slight decrease in the thickness and order of the membrane.},

  abstract = {This work systematically explores the biomineralization of calcium phosphate (CaP) and carbonate (CaCO3) within chitosan/iota-carrageenan multilayer films. Multilayer films of chitosan and iota-carrageenan (up to 128-coupled layers) were prepared on glass substrates by a layer-by-layer dip-coating technique. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy revealed dense interfaces between the chitosan and iota-carrageenan layers with thicknesses in the range 250 and 350 nm in the hydrated state, accounting for the iridescent nature of multilayer films when wet. Immersion of the multilayered films in simulated body fluid or simulated seawater at 25 °C resulted in the mineralization of CaP and CaCO3, respectively, at the interfaces between the biopolymer layers and modified the iridescence of the films. Lamellar scattering features in small-angle neutron scattering measurements of the mineralized films provided evidence of the localized mineralization. Further evidence of this was found through the lack of change in the dynamic and static correlation lengths of the polymer networks within the bulk phase of the chitosan and iota-carrageenan layers. CaP mineralization occurred to a greater extent than CaCO3 mineralization within the films, evidenced by the higher lamellar density and greater rigidity of the CaP-mineralized films. Results provide valuable new insights into CaP and CaCO3 biomineralization in biopolymer networks.},

Dry particle analysis utilising transmission electron microscopy (TEM), Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) all confirmed the thickness of the polymer brush shell increased as a function of polymerisation time. Hydrodynamic diameter and electrophoretic mobility results revealed that the brush modified particles transitioned from swollen shells to a collapsed conformation between 15 and 35 1C. The dispersions were electrosterically stabilised over the entire temperature range investigated, with minimal thermal hysteresis recorded. Modelling of the hydrodynamic diameter enabled the calculation of a lower critical solution temperature (LCST) which increased as a function of brush thickness. The internal structure determined via SANS showed a swollen brush at low temperatures (18 and 25 1C) which decayed radially away from the substrate, while a collapsed block- like conformation with 60% polymer volume fraction was present at 40 1C. Radial phase separation was evident at intermediate temperatures (30 and 32.5 1C) with the lower molecular weight sample having a greater volume fraction of polymer in the dense inner region at these temperatures.},

  abstract = {refnx is a model-based neutron and X-ray reflectometry data analysis package written in Python. It is cross platform and has been tested on Linux, macOS and Windows. Its graphical user interface is browser based, through a Jupyter notebook. Model construction is modular, being composed from a series of components that each describe a subset of the interface, parameterized in terms of physically relevant parameters (volume fraction of a polymer, lipid area per molecule etc.). The model and data are used to create an objective, which is used to calculate the residuals, log-likelihood and log-prior probabilities of the system. Objectives are combined to perform co-refinement of multiple data sets and mixed-area models. Prior knowledge of parameter values is encoded as probability distribution functions or bounds on all parameters in the system. Additional prior probability terms can be defined for sets of components, over and above those available from the parameters alone. Algebraic parameter constraints are available. The softwares offers a choice of fitting approaches, including least-squares (global and gradient-based optimizers) and a Bayesian approach using a Markov-chain Monte Carlo algorithm to investigate the posterior distribution of the model parameters. The Bayesian approach is useful for examining parameter covariances, model selection and variability in the resulting scattering length density profiles. The package is designed to facilitate reproducible research; its use in Jupyter notebooks, and subsequent distribution of those notebooks as supporting information, permits straightforward reproduction of analyses.},

  abstract = {Neutron scattering experiments are a unique tool in material science due to their sensitivity to light elements and magnetic induction. However, for kinetic studies the low brilliance at existing sources poses challenges. In the case of periodic excitations these challenges can be overcome by binning the scattering signal according to the excitation state of the sample. To advance into this direction we have performed polarised and time resolved grazing incidence neutron scattering measurements on an aqueous solution of the polymer F127 mixed with magnetic nano-particles. Magnetic nano-composites like this provide magnetically tuneable properties of the polymer crystal as well as magnetic meta-crystals. Even though the grazing incidence small angle scattering and polarised signals are too weak to be evaluated at this stage we demonstrate that such experiments are feasible. Moreover, we show that the intensity of the 111 Bragg peak of the fcc micellar crystal depends on the actual shear rate, with the signal being maximised when the shear rate is lowest (and vice-versa).},

  abstract = {Hypothesis
Anionic surfactants have been reported to interact with poly(N-isopropyl acrylamide) (PNIPAM), suppressing its thermoresponse. Scattering and NMR studies of the anionic sodium dodecylsulfate (SDS) system propose that the PNIPAM-surfactant interaction is purely hydrophobic. However, prior phenomenological investigations of a range of surfactant identities (anionic, cationic, nonionic) show that only anionic surfactants affect the thermoresponse and conformation of PNIPAM, implying that the hydrophilic head–group also contributes. Crucially, the phenomenological experiments do not measure the affinity of the tested surfactants to the polymer, only their effect on its behaviour.
Experiments
We study the adsorption of six surfactants within a planar PNIPAM brush system, elucidating the polymer conformation, thermoresponse, and surfactant adsorption kinetics using ellipsometry, neutron reflectometry (NR), optical reflectometry and the quartz crystal microbalance technique. NR is used to measure the distribution of surfactants within the brush.
Findings
We find that only anionic surfactants modify the structure and thermoresponse of PNIPAM, with the greater affinity of anionic surfactants for PNIPAM (relative to cationic and nonionic surfactants) being the primary reason for this behaviour. These results show that the surfactant head–group has a more critical role in mediating PNIPAM-surfactant interaction than previously reported. Taking inspiration from prior molecular dynamics work on the PEO-surfactant system, we propose an interaction mechanism for PNIPAM and SDS that reconciles evidence for hydrophobic interaction with the observed head–group-dependent affinity.},

  abstract = {Hypothesis
Specific ion effects govern myriad biological phenomena, including protein–ligand interactions and enzyme activity. Despite recent advances, detailed understanding of the role of ion hydrophobicity in specific ion effects, and the intersection with hydrotropic effects, remains elusive. Short chain fatty acid sodium salts are simple amphiphiles which play an integral role in our gastrointestinal health. We hypothesise that increasing a fatty acid’s hydrophobicity will manifest stronger salting-out behaviour.
Experiments
Here we study the effect of these amphiphiles on an exemplar thermoresponsive polymer brush system, conserving the carboxylate anion identity while varying anion hydrophobicity via the carbon chain length. Ellipsometry and quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring were used to characterise the thermoresponse and viscoelasticity of the brush, respectively, whilst neutron reflectometry was used to reveal the internal structure of the brush. Diffusion-ordered nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and computational investigations provide insight into polymer-ion interactions.
Findings
Surface sensitive techniques unveiled a non-monotonic trend in salting-out ability with increasing anion hydrophobicity, revealing the bundle-like morphology of the ion-collapsed system. An intersection between ion-specific and hydrotropic effects was observed both experimentally and computationally; trending from good anti-hydrotrope towards hydrotropic behaviour with increasing anion hydrophobicity, accompanying a change in hydrophobic hydration.},

  abstract = {Abstract Time-of-flight neutron reflectometry (ToF-NR) performed under different relative humidity conditions demonstrates that polymer brushes constituted by hydrophilic, cyclic macromolecules exhibit a more compact conformation with lower roughness as compared to linear brush analogues, due to the absence of dangling chain ends extending at the polymer-vapor interface. In addition, cyclic brushes feature a larger swelling ratio and an increased solvent uptake with respect to their linear counterparts as a consequence of the increased interchain steric repulsions. We propose that differences in swelling ratios between linear and cyclic brushes come from differences in osmotic pressure experienced by each brush topology. These differences stem from entropic constraints. Our findings suggest that to correlate the equilibrium swelling ratios at different relative humidity for different topologies a new form of the Flory-like expression for equilibrium thicknesses of grafted brushes is needed.

    abstract = "{The capture of moisture from the atmosphere through condensation has the potential to provide a sustainable source of water. Here, we investigate the condensation of humid air at low subcooling condition (11 °C), similar to conditions for natural dew capture, and explore how water contact angle and contact angle hysteresis affect the rates of water capture. We compare water collection on three families of surfaces: (i) hydrophilic (polyethylene oxide, MPEO) and hydrophobic (polydimethylsiloxane, PDMS) molecularly thin coatings grafted on smooth silicon wafers, which produce slippery covalently attached liquid surfaces (SCALSs), with low contact angle hysteresis (CAH = 6°); (ii) the same coatings grafted on rougher glass, with high CAH (20°–25°); (iii) hydrophilic polymer surfaces [poly(N-vinylpyrrolidone), PNVP] with high CAH (30°). Upon exposure to water, the MPEO SCALS swell, which likely further increases their droplet shedding ability. MPEO and PDMS coatings collect similar volume of water (around 5 l m−2 day−1), both when they are SCALS and non-slippery. Both MPEO and PDMS layers collect about 20\\% more water than PNVP surfaces. We present a basic model showing that, under low heat flux conditions, on all MPEO and PDMS layers, the droplets are so small (600–2000 µm) that there is no/low heat conduction resistance across the droplets, irrespective of the exact value of contact angle and CAH. As the time to first droplet departure is much faster on MPEO SCALS (28 min) than on PDMS SCALS (90 min), slippery hydrophilic surfaces are preferable in dew collection applications where the collection time frame is limited.}",

    abstract = {Abstract The effect of electron-beam patterning on the water uptake and ionic conductivity of Nafion films using a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, quartz crystal microbalance studies, neutron reflectometry, and impedance spectroscopy is reported. The aim is to further characterize the nanoscale patterned Nafion structures recently used as a key element in novel ion-to-electron transducers by Gluschke et al. To enable this, the electron beam patterning process is developed for large areas, achieving patterning speeds approaching 1 cm2 h−1, and patterned areas as large as 7 cm2 for the neutron reflectometry studies. It is ultimately shown that electron-beam patterning affects both the water uptake and the ionic conductivity, depending on film thickness. Type-II adsorption isotherm behavior is seen for all films. For thick films (≈230 nm), a strong reduction in water uptake with electron-beam patterning is found. In contrast, for thin films (≈30 nm), electron-beam patterning enhances water uptake. Notably, for either thickness, the reduction in ionic conductivity arising from electron-beam patterning is kept to less than an order of magnitude. Mechanisms are proposed for the observed behavior based on the known complex morphology of Nafion films to motivate future studies of electron-beam processed Nafion.}

    abstract = {Slippery covalently-attached liquid surfaces (SCALS) with low contact angle hysteresis (CAH, <5◦) and nanoscale thickness display impressive anti-adhesive properties, similar to lubricant-infused surfaces. Their efficacy is generally attributed to the liquid-like mobility of the constituent tethered chains. However, the precise physico-chemical properties that facilitate this mobility are unknown, hindering rational design. This work quantifies the chain length, grafting density, and microviscosity of a range of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) SCALS, elucidating the nanostructure responsible for their properties. Three prominent methods are used to produce SCALS, with characterization carried out via single-molecule force measurements, neutron reflectometry, and fluorescence correlation spectroscopy. CO2 snow-jet cleaning was also shown to reduce the CAH of SCALS via a modification of their grafting density. SCALS behavior can be predicted by reduced grafting density, Σ, with the lowest water CAH achieved at Σ ≈ 2. This study provides the first direct examination of SCALS grafting density, chain length, and microviscosity and supports the hypothesis that SCALS properties stem from a balance of layer uniformity and mobility.}

    abstract = {Hypersaline environments are ubiquitous in nature and are found in myriad technological processes. Recent empirical studies have revealed a significant discrepancy between the predicted and observed screening lengths at high salt concentrations, a phenomenon referred to as underscreening. Herein we investigate underscreening using a cationic polyelectrolyte brush as an exemplar. Poly(2-(methacryloyloxy)ethyl)trimethylammonium (PMETAC) brushes were synthesised and their internal structural changes and swelling response monitored with neutron reflectometry and spectroscopic ellipsometry. Both techniques revealed a monotonic brush collapse as the concentration of symmetric monovalent electrolyte increased. However, a non-monotonic change in brush thickness was observed in all multivalent electrolytes at higher electrolyte concentrations, known as re-entrant swelling; indicative of underscreening. For all electrolytes, numerical self-consistent field theory predictions align with experimental studies in the low salt concentration (Debye–Hu ̈ckel) region. Analysis suggests that the classical theory of electrolytes is insufficient to describe the screening lengths observed at high salt concentrations and that the re-entrant polyelectrolyte brush swelling in the high salt concentration region is consistent with regular underscreening.}

This technique takes advantage of the unique properties of NIR light, in particular enhanced penetration, to effectively prepare polymeric coatings, even through barriers that are opaque to visible light. The NIR-mediated SI-PhotoRAFT polymerization technique was utilized to precisely modulate brush height in direct correlation with the irradiation time. Additionally, this technique facilitated sequential chain extension, enabling the fabrication of block copolymer brushes. Moreover, the incorporation of a photoresponsive monomer, 7-[4-(trifluoromethyl)coumarin]acrylamide [2-(2-oxo-4-(trifluoromethyl)-2H-chromen-7-yl)acrylamide, TCAm], within the poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) brushes enables orthogonal control over polymerization and cross-linking processes through the use of two different wavelengths (NIR and UV light). When exposed to a UV source (λ = 365 nm, 18.2 mW/cm2), the TCAm undergoes dimerization triggering cross-linking of the grafted brush “arms”. Furthermore, by utilizing the enhanced penetration of NIR light, a polymeric coating was prepared on the inner walls of a tube that was opaque to visible light. Finally, this process is successfully applied to the synthesis of antifouling surfaces on poly(dimethylsiloxane)-coated silicon wafers, leading to inhibition of biofouling. }

    abstract = {Abstract Amphipathic copolymers are useful materials for nanomedicine, owing to their ability to self-assemble into nanoparticles, act as surfactants for inorganic materials, or for their favorable interactions with lipid membranes. Despite their widespread use, there is still a range of questions about the physicochemical properties that are necessary to drive their interactions at biological interfaces. To fully understand these interactions requires a diverse range of complementary analytical techniques. In this work, a library of neutral amphipathic methacrylate copolymers is synthesized by reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer polymerization (RAFT) polymerization, to investigate the effect of polymer composition and nature of the hydrophobic comonomer on interactions with model lipid membranes. These materials are shown to interact with Langmuir lipid monolayers, and neutron reflectometry demonstrates that hydrophobic interactions lead to the polymers intercalating with the monolayers. More complex models of lipid bilayers are studied using an in situ quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) model and shows while the composition and hydrophobic comonomer affect the stability of these interactions, there is no effect on the viscoelasticity of the lipid membranes. The in-depth understanding of these interfacial interactions afforded by this suite of analytical tools will allow for more complex copolymers to be studied, providing a greater understanding of key processes in nanomedicine, such as cellular entry and endosomal escape.}
